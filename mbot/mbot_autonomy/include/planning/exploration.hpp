/**
* Exploration runs a simple state machine to explore -- and possibly escape from -- an environment. The state machine
* for Exploration goes through the following steps:
* 
*   - INITIALIZING:
*       start in this state and immediately change states
*           go to EXPLORING_MAP
*   - EXPLORING_MAP;
*       select frontiers and drive to them until all frontiers have been explored
*           go to RETURNING_HOME if the map is explored
*           go to FAILED_EXPLORATION if all frontiers cannot be reached for some reason
*   - RETURNING_HOME:
*       drive back to the home pose -- the first pose received by the exploration module
*           go to COMPLETED_EXPLORATION after reaching the hoome pose if escape mode isn't used
*           go to FAILED_EXPLORATION if a path to the home pose can't be found
*   - COMPLETED_EXPLORATION:
*       stop the robot, exit with SUCCESS
*   - FAILED_EXPLORATION:
*       stop the robot, exit with FAILURE
