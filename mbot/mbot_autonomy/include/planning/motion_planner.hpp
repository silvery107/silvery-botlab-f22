* 
* To use the motion planner:
* 
*   - Set the current map of the environment via the setMap method. Whenever the occupancy grid changes, you'll need to
*     call setMap again for the planner to include the updates to the grid.
*   - Select a valid goal pose using the isValidGoal method, which confirms that the goal isn't too close to a wall
*     for the robot to reach
*   - Find a path to the goal using the planPath method. Use the robot's current estimated pose as the start.
